# Splitsy

It's a Flutter project under the primary name "calculate_exchange_v2".

This repository is my second complete project. Since I made it myself from scratch, it has many UI/UX flaws.
You can download the application on 
[google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nillApp.Splitsy&gl=DE).

Here is a view of how it works:


## Getting Started:

[![First view of the app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/P_u8ZMsel7w/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/P_u8ZMsel7w)

## Change Name inside the sheet:

## You can change Currency:

## Or easily delete all the data:

## Add sheet without any specific name:

## Or even delete and change name from outside of the sheet:

## However, there is more to show!
You can edit each transition(or share) that you add or add people with 0 spent money to calculate their share. In the end, the calculate button will calculate shares depending on the data you added.

I also should mention some of the **animations**. On the sheet page, when it's empty, you can see the add card changes scale, and the cloud picture rotates, at the same time.

When you enter a sheet with data, they appear in sequence. You can see a glimpse in the *Change name inside sheet*.
